# 🌌 COSMOGRAPH: Thermodynamic Atlas

**An interactive simulation of Large-Scale Structure formation driven by Statistical Mechanics.**

## 📖 Overview
COSMOGRAPH visualizes the "Cosmic Web" not just as gravity, but as a thermodynamic system minimizing free energy. It simulates the interplay between dark matter halos, baryonic nodes, and cosmic voids using real-time N-body physics and Boltzmann statistics.

## ⚙️ The Physics Engine
This simulation implements three core theoretical frameworks visible in the interface:

1.  **Free Energy Minimization (`F = U - TS`)**
    Structures nucleate where free energy is minimized. The simulation demonstrates how ordered structures (galaxies) emerge from the primordial plasma as the universe cools.

2.  **Einstein’s Field Equations (`G_μν = 8πG T_μν`)**
    Node movement is dictated by spacetime curvature. Mass-energy density (`T_μν`) directly influences the geodesic paths of particles.

3.  **Fluctuation Theorem**
    Local entropy decreases spontaneously to form structures, balanced by the global increase of entropy in the expanding voids.

## 🛠 Features
- **Real-Time Microstate Inspector:** Hover over any node to read local Temperature, Entropy (`S`), and Curvature (`κ`).
- **Dark Matter Visualization:** Renders the invisible scaffolding of the universe using probabilistic particle distribution.
- **Phase Space Diagram:** Dynamic mapping of the Equation of State (Radiation vs. Matter vs. Vacuum dominance).

## 🚀 Usage
1.  **Zoom/Pan:** Use mouse wheel to zoom, click-and-drag to pan.
2.  **Probe:** Hover cursor over "Cluster Cores" or "Singularities" to inspect thermodynamic variables.
3.  **Controls:** Use the bottom-right HUD to Pause, Reset, or adjust the simulation scale.

## 💼 Professional Application
This engine demonstrates advanced computational modeling capabilities applicable to:
- Thermal management systems (e.g., battery packs, industrial reactors)
- Fluid dynamics & particle dispersion (e.g., asphalt additives, chemical mixing)
- Complex network visualization (e.g., supply chains, financial markets)
